  I am a PhD researcher in Computational Neuroscience at the University of Tübingen and a member of the International Max Planck Research School for Mental Mechanisms of Function and Dysfunction. My work involves human intracranial electrophysiology to study memory and visual processing. My doctoral training combines experimental neuroscience (human intracranial recordings using clinical electrophysiology systems) with quantitative analysis of neural data. 
I develop careful analysis pipelines for single-neuron and local field potential recordings, drawing on signal processing methods (spectral analysis, connectivity measures) as well as decoding and dimensionality reduction based approaches.
My broader goal is to understand brain function and developing insights that can help treat disorders.
