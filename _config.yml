  I am a PhD researcher in Computational Neuroscience at the University of Tübingen and a member of the International Max Planck Research School for Mental Mechanisms of Function and Dysfunction.
  My doctoral training combines experimental neuroscience (human intracranial recordings using electrophysiology systems) with quantitative analysis of neural data to understand memory and visual processing. I develop python pipelines for empirical analysis and visualization using human single-neuron and local field potential recordings, employing signal processing methods (like spectral analysis and connectivity measures) alongside decoding and dimensionality reduction based approaches. 
  Broadly, my goal is to apply data science principles to understand brain function from high-dimensional neural data and to generate insights that can inform treatments for neurological and psychiatric disorders.
